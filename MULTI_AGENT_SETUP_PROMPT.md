- **Available tools** and MCP integrations
- **Response format** (JSON structured)
- **Performance targets** and metrics

#### 4. Orchestration Logic
- **Task complexity analysis**
- **Intelligent agent routing**

- **Error handling and recovery**

### 🛠️ TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

#### Programming Language: Python 3.8+
Required packages:
```python
# Core coordination
import json
import time
import fcntl
import os
import uuid
import threading
from datetime import datetime, timezone
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Dict, List, Optional, Any
from dataclasses import dataclass, asdict
from enum import Enum
```
