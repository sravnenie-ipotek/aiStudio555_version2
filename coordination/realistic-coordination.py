Realistic Claude Code AI Coordination

This provides ACTUAL coordination help that works within Claude Code's constraints.
Instead of spawning separate processes, it uses intelligent task decomposition
and existing Claude Code tools to simulate multi-agent coordination.

REALITY CHECK:
- Claude Code sessions are isolated
- Can't spawn other Claude instances  
- Can't import arbitrary local files
- BUT can use Task tool and intelligent workflows

# WHAT ACTUALLY WORKS:

REALISTIC_APPROACH = """
üéØ REALISTIC CLAUDE CODE COORDINATION

Instead of complex orchestration, use these WORKING approaches:

1. **Task Tool with Role Injection**:
   Use Task tool with specific agent role prompts:
   
   Task(subagent_type="general-purpose", prompt="
   üîµ SEARCH SPECIALIST: Find all authentication patterns in codebase.
   Use only Grep, Glob, Read tools. Report findings systematically.
   ")

2. **Intelligent Tool Sequencing**:
   Use tools in coordinated sequence:
   
   Phase 1: Grep/Glob (discovery) 
   Phase 2: Read (analysis)
   Phase 3: Write/Edit (implementation)
   Phase 4: Task tool (review)

3. **MCP Server Integration**:
   Use existing MCP servers strategically:
   
   - Context7 for patterns and documentation
   - Sequential for complex analysis
   - Magic for UI generation
   
4. **Smart Prompting**:
   Use role-based prompts within single session:
   
   "Acting as a search specialist, find..."
   "Now as implementation specialist, create..."
   "Finally as reviewer, validate..."

5. **Workflow Templates**:
   Create systematic approaches for common tasks:
   
   IMPLEMENT_FEATURE_WORKFLOW:
   1. Search existing patterns
   2. Analyze requirements  
   3. Generate implementation
   4. Review and test
